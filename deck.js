* Spend is not the same as emissions, price signals can change (discounts, vendor deals, procurement quirks), and high-cost services can be low-carbon while low-cost services can be dirty.
* As we mature, we move from spend-based estimates to activity-based measurements: actual energy use, grid carbon intensity by region and hour, workload footprints, embodied emissions of hardware, and lifecycle impacts.
